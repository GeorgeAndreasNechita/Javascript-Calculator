# Javascript-Calculator
Simple calculator I made to learn how to better use Javascript along with HTML and CSS.
The layout was made with CSS grid and the calculator funtioning with Javascript.

This is my second personal project, made by myself from 0. The javascript part required a lot of thinking, especially making the rules about when can you place 0 and commas(for example the first and second digit from the number cannot be both 0, but the first one can, but only if it's a decimal number, or that you canno't start the number with a comma or place 2 or more commas in the same number). 

So in short there were a lot of rules about how the calculator and the numbers inputs worked, many which contradicted themselves.
